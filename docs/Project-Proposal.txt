Problem Statement 

Manual fruit classification and billing requires human effort, can introduce errors, and 
is inefficient for fast-paced environments. There is a need for an automated solution 
that can: 

●  Detect multiple fruits in a single image 

● 

Identify fruit types accurately 

●  Count the number of each fruit 

●  Assign predefined prices 

●  Calculate the total cost automatically

Introduction and Objectives 

With  the  rapid  advancement  of  artificial  intelligence  and  computer  vision, 
automated  object  detection  systems  are  becoming  increasingly  useful  in 
real-world  applications  such  as  smart  retail,  self-checkout  systems,  and 
agricultural  monitoring.  Traditional  methods  of  identifying  fruits,  counting 
quantities,  and  calculating  prices  require  manual  effort,  which  can  be 
time-consuming and prone to human error. 

This  project  proposes  an  AI-based  Fruit  Detection  and  Pricing  System 
that  allows  users  to  capture images using a camera or upload images, 
automatically  detect  multiple  fruits  in  a  single  image,  identify  the  fruit 
type, quantity, and color, and calculate the total price using predefined 

 
rates. The system is designed to be simple, efficient, and user-friendly. 

Key Objectives: 

●    To detect and classify fruits from images using computer vision 

●   To support multiple fruits in one image 

●   To estimate fruit quantity by counting detected objects 

●   To identify fruit color using image analysis 

●   To calculate total price using predefined fruit rates 

●   To develop a simple user interface for image upload or camera input 

Dataset Description 

1 Dataset Source 

●  Name: Fruit-Images-Dataset 

●  Author: Horea94 

●  Link: https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset 

2 Dataset Overview 

The Fruit-Images-Dataset contains high-quality images of various fruits 
captured under controlled conditions with consistent backgrounds. For this 
project, the dataset will be filtered to include selected fruit classes such as: 

●  Apple 

●  Banana 

●  Orange 

●  Mango 

3 Data Preprocessing 

●  Image resizing (e.g., 416 × 416 pixels) 

●  Normalization 

●  Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment) 

●  Dataset split: 

o  80% Training 

o  10% Validation 

o  10% Testing 

 
 
Methodology and Techniques 

●  Primary Technique: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once): 

1.  Why?: State-of-the-art for real-time object detection. It detects 
objects in a single pass, outputting bounding boxes and class 
probabilities, ideal for counting quantities. 

2.  Implementation: Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv8 model on the 

dataset. Train for 50-100 epochs with data augmentation. 

3.  Advantages: Fast inference (suitable for real-time apps), handles 
multiple objects per image, and provides confidence scores for 
filtering detections. 

●  Supporting Techniques: 

1.  CNN-Based  Classification  (Convolutional  Neural  Networks):  Use 
ResNet50 or Efficient-Net as a backbone in YOLO for feature extraction 
and classification into the 4 classes. 

2.  Image  Pre-processing:  OpenCV  for  resizing,  normalization, and noise 

reduction. 

3.  Post-Processing: Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate 

overlapping detections; threshold confidence >0.5 for accurate counting. 

4.  Quantity Estimation: Count bounding boxes per class (e.g., 3 Apples 

detected). 

5.  Pricing Integration: Use a Python dictionary for prices. Calculate 

total: total = sum(quantity[class] * price[class] for class in 
detected_classes). 

●  Training and Evaluation: 

1.  Metrics: mAP@0.5 (mean Average Precision) for detection 

accuracy; precision/recall for classification. 

2.  Tools: PyTorch for YOLOv8, Weights & Biases for logging. 
3.  Expected Performance: >85% mAP on test set, with low false 

positives. 

Proposed System Overview 
The proposed system is an AI-based fruit detection and pricing application 
that allows users to capture images using a camera or upload images from 
a device. The system automatically detects multiple fruits in a single image, 
identifies their type, quantity, and color, and calculates the total price using 
predefined rates. The overall system is designed to be efficient, 

user-friendly, and suitable for real-world applications such as smart retail 
and automated billing. 

(cid:0)  System Workflow 

The system follows a structured workflow to ensure accurate detection and 
pricing: 

1.  The user captures or uploads an image using the system interface. 

2.  The input image is preprocessed (resizing and normalization). 

3.  The trained object detection model detects fruits in the image. 

4.  Each detected fruit is classified into its respective category. 

5.  The quantity of each fruit type is calculated by counting detections. 

6.  Fruit color is identified using image processing techniques. 

7.  Predefined prices are applied to each fruit category. 

8.  The total price is calculated and displayed to the user. 

(cid:0)  System Architecture 

The system architecture consists of the following main components: 

●  Image Acquisition Module: Captures images through a camera or 

allows image upload. 

●  Preprocessing Module: Resizes and normalizes images for model 

input. 

●  Fruit Detection Module: Uses a YOLO-based deep learning model 

to detect and classify fruits. 

●  Quantity & Color Analysis Module: Counts detected fruits and 

determines their color. 

●  Pricing Module: Applies predefined prices and calculates the total 

cost. 

●  User Interface Module: Displays detected fruits, quantities, colors, 

and total price. 

Tools and Technologies 

●  Programming: Python 3.x 

 
  
 
 
●  Libraries: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy

Performance Evaluation 

1. Accuracy of fruit detection 
2. Correct quantity estimation 
3. Correct price calculation 
4. System response time 
5.  Web app (Flask/Stream_lit) for image upload and results display 

(e.g., "Detected: 2 Apples (1.50) - Total: $5.50"). 

6.  Report on accuracy, challenges (e.g., overlapping fruits), and 

improvements.

● Smart retail checkout systems 

● Automated fruit shops 

● Agricultural monitoring 

● Educational AI projects

colors, and calculates total prices automatically. The system highlights how 
AI can improve efficiency, accuracy, and user experience in real-world 
applications.
